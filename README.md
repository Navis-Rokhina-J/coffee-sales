# coffee-sales-dashboard
This dashboard provides a visual overview of coffee sales data. It includes several interactive elements (filters/slicers) and charts to analyze sales trends across different dimensions
### Project purpose:
         To provide a visual and interactive overview of coffee sales data, enabling analysis of sales trends across various dimensions such as product type, region, and customer loyalty
### Project goals:
         Track Sales Performance: Monitor overall sales trends over time and identify peak seasons or periods of decline
         Analyze Sales by Product: Understand which roast types, sizes, and bean types are most popular
         Evaluate Sales by Region/Country: Compare sales performance across different geographical locations
         Assess Impact of Loyalty Programs: Determine if the loyalty program is driving sales
         Monitor Sales Team Performance: Track individual sales representative performance and identify top performers
         Data-Driven Decision Making: Provide insights to inform business decisions related to inventory, marketing, and sales strategies
### Key Findings:
         Bean Type Preferences: It seems some bean types sell more than others, this can be seen by comparing the lines on the "Total Sales Over Time" graph
         Geographic Sales Distribution: The horizontal bar chart shows sales vary significantly by country. The United States appears to be the strongest market
         Sales Representative Performance: The vertical bar chart indicates varying performance levels among sales representatives. Allis Wilmore appears to be the top performer
         Loyalty Program Impact (Not Directly Shown): While the filter exists, without seeing the data change when filtering by "Loyalty Card," it's impossible to determine its direct impact. However, the dashboard allows for this analysis
         Sales Growth (Potentially): Comparing the overall trend from 2019 to 2022 might suggest growth, but this is difficult to definitively assess without clear axis labeling on the time chart
### Tools and Technologies:
Data Preparation and visualization: Excel
